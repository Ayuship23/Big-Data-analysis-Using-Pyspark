## 📌 Project Overview

With the increasing volume of streaming content, analyzing data at scale has become essential. This project leverages **PySpark** to perform big data analysis on the Netflix dataset, uncovering insights into content types, trends, production countries, and release timelines.

---

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- 🔄 Perform distributed data loading and processing using PySpark
- 🧹 Data cleaning and schema optimization
- 📊 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix content
- 📅 Analyze content release trends by year
- 🌍 Discover country-wise content production and distribution
- 🎬 Classify data into Movies vs TV Shows
- 🔎 Identify most frequent directors, actors, and genres

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark (PySpark)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Netflix Titles Dataset (CSV)**
- **Python Libraries**:  
  - `pyspark.sql` for DataFrame operations  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` (for optional plotting)  
  - `pandas` (used for post-processing or visualization)
